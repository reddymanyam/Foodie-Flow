For SPA(single page applications) used routers, imported from the react-router-dom,<br>

### useState
In this project, we utilize the `useState` hook from React to manage local state within functional components. It provides a concise way to handle component-level state without the need for class components. 
import React, { useState } from 'react';<br>

### useEffect
The useEffect hook is employed for handling side effects in functional components. It allows us to perform actions after the component has rendered, such as data fetching or interacting with the DOM.<br>


### useParams
For handling route parameters in a React Router-enabled application, we use the useParams hook from react-router-dom<br>
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
